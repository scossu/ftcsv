   ftcsv is a fast and easy to use csv library for lua. It can read in CSV files,
   do some basic transformations (rename fields, retain, etc) and can create a CSV file.
   It supports UTF-8, header-less CSVs, and maintaining correct line endings for
   multi-line fields.

   It supports loading an entire CSV file into memory and parsing it as well as
   buffered reading of a CSV file.
